There are multiple levels of disk I/O routines.  The interpreter contains
functions that map to the monitor requests.  The monitor requests invoke
MONITOR functions which put the request into the memory window shared with
the controller.  Finally, the firmware contains functions that finally do
the operations.

Request blocks are shared between the monitor request functions and the disk drivers.

The physical disk address in the request block is updated by a disk
read or write.

There are three monitor calls for disk I/O:  Read, write, and wait for
asynchronous completion.  One sector at a time is transfered.

Most of my disks are double-density, 512 bytes per sector, and use the 
"optimized" sector layout.

Unit numbers are 4 and 5, or 0 and 1.

"Relative disk addresses" are linear block numbers.  There is a monitor
entry point which converts these to physical addresses, getting the disk
format from the request block and storing the computed physical address
into the request block.
