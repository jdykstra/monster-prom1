DSKCTL appears on both OS and INTERP.  The copy on OS is later than the one on INTERP;  version E6 vs. version D1.  Only OS contains the KEY_TBL.TEXT file which puts the "new" keyboard translation table on the end of the DSKCTL binary.

KEYREAD.TEXT?

The copy of DSKCTL.TXT on INTERP also seems to have termination messages from SNOBOL on the end of it.
